## Day 9
*29 June 2019*

Knowing that I was going to be out the whole day, I thought of a way to still continue doing 100 Days of Code without actually having to code anything. I remembered going to a data science talk and I asked the speaker what MOOCs would be nice entries into data science. He mentioned the course I Heart Stats. I looked it up and found out that its full name was [I "Heart" Stats: Learning to Love Statistics](https://www.edx.org/course/i-heart-stats-learning-to-love-statistics) and that it was offered by the University of Notre Dame.

There were some videos at the start of the course that covered some math basics, but I watched them just in case there were concepts that I didn't know. All the topics turned out to be concepts that I already knew. There was also a video that talked about variables (independent, dependent).

The first pieces of information that were actually new to me were the levels of information: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio. It was interesting to learn that there are some techniques that are exclusive to the higher levels of information. Also, techniques applicable to lower levels of information are applicable to the higher levels, but some information will be lost in doing so.
