#### Day 1
*11 June 2019*
*6:40 PM - 10:00 PM*

Since I haven't been doing much coding prior to this day, I deemed that it would be nice to get back into the rhythm of it all by solving a few of the easier problems on Codeforces. I looked at the problems that have been solved the most and decided to solve the ones that I haven't solved yet.

I didn't really plan how long I would solve problems or how many I wanted to solve, but I just kept going until I felt like it. I ended up solving 12 problems in 3 hours and 20 minutes, averaging around 17 minutes for each problem. I solved the majority of them in 8 minutes or less (which is still pretty bad considering the difficulty of the probelms), but there were a few problems wherein I got stuck trying to fix a solution using an incorrect approach or wherein I would implement something standard quite slowly. It just goes to show how much the lack of practice affects the speed in coding and analysis of the problem.

Around a third of my time was spent on solving the problem Two Buttons. I got stuck trying to implement a recursive DP solution, which did not work because I didn't account for the "loops" that were present in the "graph". I didn't even recognize that it was a graph problem until I read the [editorial](http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/16736). What shocked me most was that there was a much simpler greedy solution, that involved a "reversal" of the problem. What bugged me about this is that I have encountered all these concepts before, but I was not able to detect them right away (again, mostly due to a lack of practice.) My final solution for this problem involved a simple iterative BFS solution with states.

I listed below the problems that I was able to solve and the amount of time (based on the time differences between AC submissions) it took me to solve them.
