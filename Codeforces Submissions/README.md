## Day 1
*11 June 2019, 6:40 PM - 10:00 PM*

Since I haven't been doing much coding prior to this day, I deemed that it would be nice to get back into the rhythm of it all by solving a few of the easier problems on Codeforces. I looked at the problems that have been solved the most and decided to solve the ones that I haven't solved yet.

I didn't really plan how long I would solve problems or how many I wanted to solve, but I just kept going until I felt like it. I ended up solving 12 problems in 3 hours and 20 minutes, averaging around 17 minutes for each problem. I solved the majority of them in 8 minutes or less (which is still pretty bad considering the difficulty of the probelms), but there were a few problems wherein I got stuck trying to fix a solution using an incorrect approach or wherein I would implement something standard quite slowly. It just goes to show how much the lack of practice affects the speed in coding and analysis of the problem.

Around a third of my time was spent on solving the problem Two Buttons. I got stuck trying to implement a recursive DP solution, which did not work because I didn't account for the "loops" that were present in the "graph". I didn't even recognize that it was a graph problem until I read the [editorial](http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/16736). What shocked me most was that there was a much simpler greedy solution, that involved a "reversal" of the problem. What bugged me about this is that I have encountered all these concepts before, but I was not able to detect them right away (again, mostly due to a lack of practice.) My final solution for this problem involved a simple iterative BFS solution with states.

I listed below the problems that I was able to solve and the amount of time (based on the time differences between AC submissions) it took me to solve them.

## Day 12
*5 July 2019*

Since I was going to have a coding exam in the morning of this day, I decided to get warmed up with a bunch of easy problems. I did the same thing I did back in day 1: I looked at the problems that have been solved the most and decided to solve the ones that I haven't solved yet. These problems are listed below.
- [Soft Drinking](http://codeforces.com/contest/151/problem/A)
- [Party](http://codeforces.com/contest/115/problem/A)
- [I'm bored with life](http://codeforces.com/contest/822/problem/A)
- [Fence](http://codeforces.com/contest/363/problem/B)
- [Sort the Array](http://codeforces.com/contest/451/problem/B)

Since I was feeling kind of rusty solving graph problems, I went to ProgVar.Fun, a competitive programming training tool made by my programming team's coach, to find some of the easier [graph problems](https://progvar.fun/problemsets/graphs-basics) just to get my feet wet. The ones that I solved are listed below.
- [Road Construction](http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/330/B)
- [Bear and Three Musketeers](http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/574/B)
- [Network Topology](http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/292/B)
- [Graph And Its Complement](http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/990/D)

Later that night, there was a [Codeforces contest](http://codeforces.com/contest/1189) that was being held so I decided to join it since I haven't joined a Codeforces contest in a while. The problems I was able to solve are as follows.
- [Keanu Reeves](http://codeforces.com/contest/1189/problem/A)
- [Number Circle](http://codeforces.com/contest/1189/problem/B)
- [Candies!](http://codeforces.com/contest/1189/problem/C)
- [Add on a Tree](http://codeforces.com/contest/1189/problem/D1)

I was able to rank 696 out of 5,242 active contestants (14th percentile), but I feel like I could have ranked higher if only I were able to solve Candies! faster. I got too stuck thinking of a sum propagation solution when the solution was much much simpler. But, nevertheless, my Codeforces ranking increased by 19 so that's not so bad.
