# 100 Days of Code

This repository serves as a way to document my process and progress as I undergo the #100DaysOfCode challenge. Off the bat, I don't have any plans for projects or new things to learn for these 100 days. But my goal is to get into the habit of actively practicing or learning something new everyday by setting aside at least 1 hour a day for these purposes.

I still don't know how I'm going to format this repository, but I will be adjusting the file structure and all READMEs as I go. I plan to list down the relevant links (and perhaps personal journal entries) for each day. And I may also have links to other repositories as I go through this challenge.

That's all for now. Let's see what these next 100 days bring. *Onward and upward.*
